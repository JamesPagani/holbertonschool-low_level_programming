# 0x10. C - Variadic Functions

In this directory there'll be source files that makes use of variadic functions, functions that on top of their named arguments can recieve an infinite amount of unnamed and "typeless" arguments. In order to make use of them, however, the usage of the *stdarg* header (from C's standard library) is mandatory.
