# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

If you're managing a project with hundreds of thousands of lines of code split into many files or your executable requires a certain "compilation hierarchy" (compile this file and use it to compile another file) or just want a way to automate the re-compiling of a executable, then *GNU make* is for you.
