# 0x1E. Search Algorithms

## Contents

**0. Linear Search** (C source code): Search for a specific value in an array of integers using *linear search* and return the index of the first match found.
**1. Binary Search** (C source code): Search for a specific value in a sorted array of integers using *binary search* and return the index of the first match found.
**2. Big O #0** (Plain text): Worst-case *time complexity* of *linear search* in an array of size *n*.
**3. Big O #1** (Plain text): Worst-case *space complexity* of an (iterative) *linear search* in an array of size *n*.
**4. Big O #2** (Plain text): Worst-case *time complexity* of a binary search in an array of size *n*.
**5. Big O #3** (Plain text): Worst-case *space complexity* of a binary search in an array of size *n*.
**6. Big O #4** (Plain text): Worst-case *space complexity* of an algorithm (due to it being on Holberton's intranet, I won't show it here. Sorry).
